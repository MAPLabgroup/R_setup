# R_setup
An R script that sets up a new workspace environment and installs frequently used packages for data manipulation and plots. 

I set this up with the packages that I used for the analysis of the behavioral data from the COSPAL_JS (Jon) and COSPAL_SG (Sarah G.) studies. Please add functionality as you see fit.

Ideally we will decide on packages that we all use, maybe some originals, and then add them to this script so that anyone who wants to use R in our lab can run this and be ready to work on whatever project is at hand. 

You can run RStudio from Anaconda-Navigator which is installed on the Linux workstations and may be installed on the more powerful Windows workstations (VR room, laptop).
